# Roman numerals are represented by seven different symbols: I, V, X, L, C, D and M
# Given a roman numeral, convert it to an integer. Input is guranteed to be within the range
# from 1 to 3999. 
#Symbol  Value
#I       1
#V       5
#X       10
#L       50
#C       100
#D       500
#M       1000

# Example 1: input = III => output = 3
# Example 2: input = IV => output = 4
