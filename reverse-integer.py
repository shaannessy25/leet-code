# Given a 32-bit signed integer, reverse digits of an integer 
# Example 1: input = [1,2,3] => output = [3,2,1]
# Example 2: input = [-1,2,3] => output = [-3,2,1]
# Example 3: input: 120 => 21 
# Assume we are dealing with an enviornment which could only store integers
# within the 32-bit signed integer range: [-2^31, 2^31-1]. For the purpose
# of this problem, assume That your function returns 0 when the reversed integer
# overflows
